# _version
Pragmatic version string management


## Purpose

* Use a hard-coded version string, so users and build tools can easily
  detect it from the source code.
* Include info from git, such as number of commits since last release,
  git hash, and dirty status.
* A simple module that is easy to maintain.
* A simple mechanism to update the module in projects that it's used in.


## Usage

The "installation":

* Add the `_version.py` to the root of your library (next to the `__init__.py`).
* Set the project name and `__version__` string.
* In your `__init__.py`, use `from _version import __version__, version_info`.
* In `pyproject.toml` use `dynamic = ["version"]`.
* The Flit build tool will now detect your project version. Other tools may
  need an extra line, e.g. `[tool.hatch.version]` `path = "lib_name/_version.py"`.

When releasing:

* Just update the `__version__` string in `_version.py`.

To update the module:

* Run `python _version.py update`


## Examples

```
# End users who installed your lib using e.g. pip
0.12.0

# Dev on the same release, but installed from the repo
0.12.0+g15e3681e

# Dev on main, some time after the last release
0.12.0.post39+g93a91d54

# Dev making local changes
0.12.0.post39+g93a91d54.dirty
```

BTW, getting a version on the command line can be done with:
```
# On projects that use _version.py
python path/to/_version.py

# Generic way
python -c "import pygfx; print(pygfx.__version__)"
```


## Contributing

The `_version.py` is formatted with Ruff under a strict ruleset so it
can be adopted in most projects without changes.

On every change (i.e. PR) update `_version.py`'s version on the first line.

We don't have tests yet, because we mainly use this for projects related to PyGfx.
Maybe we can add some tests later ... though we don't expect this module to change much.
